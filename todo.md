# TODO
- modulation 
  - one wave affects other wave create new wave
    - freq modulation
    - phase modulation
    - amplitude modulation
    - phase distortion
    - ring
- envelopes
  - ADSR (attack, decay, sustain, release)
  - 8-stage (?)
- filter
  - low pass
- midicc

# IDEAS
- organise instruments/oscillators/envelopes in pools
  - accessed via indices
